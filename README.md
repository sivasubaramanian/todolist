# Description:

The Simple ToDo List Mini Project is a straightforward web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This mini project serves as a practical introduction to basic web development concepts and allows users to create a list of tasks they need to accomplish. It provides a user-friendly interface where tasks can be added, marked as completed, and removed when they are no longer needed.

# Key Features:

Add Tasks: Users can easily add tasks to the ToDo list. A text input field and an "Add" button allow users to input a task and add it to the list.

Task Status: Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on them. A visual cue, such as a strike-through or a change in text color, indicates completed tasks, making it easy for users to track their progress.

Task Removal: Completed or unwanted tasks can be removed from the list. Each task item is accompanied by a "Delete" button, allowing users to remove specific tasks with a single click.

User-Friendly Interface: The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Clear labels, responsive buttons, and interactive task items enhance the user experience.

Persistence: In some versions, the ToDo list retains its tasks even after the user refreshes the webpage. This is achieved by storing tasks in the browser's local storage, allowing users to revisit their tasks later.

# Technologies Used:

HTML: Provides the basic structure of the web page, including input fields, buttons, and task containers.

CSS: Styles the user interface, creating an attractive and responsive layout. It defines the colors, fonts, and animations to enhance the visual appeal of the ToDo list.

JavaScript: Implements the interactive features of the ToDo list. It handles user input, updates the DOM dynamically, and manages task addition, completion, and deletion functionalities.

# Learning Outcomes:

HTML Structure: Students learn how to structure a basic HTML document, create input fields, buttons, and lists to display tasks.

CSS Styling: Understanding of CSS to style HTML elements, applying styles for better user interface and experience.

JavaScript Interactivity: Students learn JavaScript programming concepts such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and conditional statements. They understand how to create interactive web applications that respond to user actions.

Local Storage: For more advanced versions, students can learn about browser local storage and how to persist data even after the page is refreshed.
